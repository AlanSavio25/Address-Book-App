# ADDRESS-BOOK

This is an address book web application that involves web technologies like SQLite and PUG. 

The app allows you to add new addresses, and then edit and remove any (or all) of them. On adding a new address, an database file will be created to store all the data. This allows the data to persist after restarting all processes.


# Usage 
Run these commands to run the project: npm install, node app.js

Then go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
